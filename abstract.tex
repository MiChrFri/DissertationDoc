\section*{Abstract}

Writing Software requires logical thinking, creativity, problem solving skills and teamwork. The whole process demands a good level of cognitive performance and a solid communication within a team.\\
However, this performance is sometimes better and sometime worse. The most people notice inconsistency in the quality and there is always a risk that a developer is producing bad code which could lead to expensive bugs and/or delays.\\
Many developers don't really know about the quality of their code, neither in a general perspective nor in their temporary performance. Even if they would know, it is not always obvious to find reasons for negative or positive changes in their code quality.
Software metrics are around for decades with the purpose to evaluate the quality and the performance of the programmer but they are used primarily for project management rather than for providing feedback to the developers.

This dissertation investigates correlations between external influences in the coding quality and the cognitive performance of programmers. 
In two experiments, mobile devices are being used to collect the contextual data of the environment and the behavior of the programmers. 
An installed application on the device of the participants gathers data from sensors and collects data which is provided by the operating system. It accesses the light sensor, the amplitude of the microphone, the step counter, a 3axis-accelerometer and the location of the device. These information are then clustered and linked to a context.\\
The first experiment investigates the single influences compared to the data of other participants in order to find general factors. In the second experiment, the focus lays on evidence for influences which are being created by a single participant. 
\bigbreak
Overall, the data gathering app is generating valuable information about the environment and context. 
The application lead to findings that provide evidence for factors that influence the brain performance for an individual participant and also for patterns which could be influences in general.
