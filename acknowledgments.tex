First, I want to thank my family who always believed in me and helped me to be the person who I am now. 
They tough me to work hard for what I want to achieve in my life and never give up until I reached my goals. 
\\
I also want to thank my supervisor Stephen Barrett for the support and trust in my works as well as the guiding I received during my dissertation. 
\\
Thank you to all my friends who kept me motivated and always listening and helping me with my problems and troubles I had. 
\\
Last but not least I want to thank everyone who volunteered to participate at the experiments for this dissertation.
