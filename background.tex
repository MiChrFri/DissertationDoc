\section{Mobile Device Sensors}
Over the last decades the evolution mobile devices began with a wireless telephone far away from pocket size. Over the years the mobile devices got displays, SMS, telephone books, games and a lot more. In 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone and with it the age of the smartphone  \cite{laugesen2010factors}. Over the years, smart-phones became pocket size computers with a better display resolution than the most televisions and the computing power of what desktop pc users could just dream about a few years ago. More and more sensors were packet into the small handy devices were made easy accessible by developers. \\
The sensors range from proximity detection over accelerometer to humidity sensors etc. Google even engineered a system for 3D objects and indoor environments with just a single device in real time.  
So, a lot of people own the hardware with the capability to collect rich context information and they even carry it with them all the time and could be used for support and improve the peoples work and environment.
