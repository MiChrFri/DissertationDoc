And a fancy conclusion...


\section{Future Work}
The results give evidence that it is very hard to find general patterns in the influences in the cognitive performance. The individual results were more clear but just valid for a single person. 
In my opinion it would be a good idea to let people individually gather data about their environment and working patterns continuously. A machine learning algorithm on the phone could find correlations between the individual performance and the data. Also, as the first experiment was just focusing on one single task, it would make sense to send the gathered data of each user to a Server that is analyzing it in relation to the data sets of the other participants. 
In experiment one, some information from some participants were not gathered because of the permissions and settings of their individual mobile devices or in some cases probably even missing sensors that were not built in that device. 
Therefore, to be able to eliminate the hardware issues a custom device to place on the desk would help to avoid these issues. It would also allow to add more sensors such as temperature, humidity etc. and with the same hardware guarantee that the sensors are working equally.
