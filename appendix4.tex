\chapter{Participant data}

These are the results of the measurements from Experiment one for each participant. 

\subsection{Graph descriptions}

\subsubsection{Accelerometer}
The accelerometer graph shows the changes of the three axis values over the time of the experiment. 

\subsubsection{Noise and Light}
The graphs of the noise and light level show the changes of the measurements (y-axis) over time (x-axis). 
The the thicker horizontal line indicates the average value and two lines, one below and the other one on top of the average is the range of the standard deviation and is treated different in the evaluation section.
